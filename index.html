            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag">
                Living rooms are one of the most popular rooms of your house so keep the look minimalistic but savvy at
                the same time. You can do this by playing around with the right colours that reflect your personality
                and enhance your mood, be it wall paint or wallpaper. You can also add new furniture and lighting to
                brighten up the space and make it more lively. Finally, don’t forget about the smaller details in terms
                of curtains or other decors as they visually make a lot of difference. A nested coffee table is a
                must-have since it adds character to a living room.

            <p class="sectionSubTag">
                When you are planning your kitchen renovation, focus on what works for you and keep the layout simple
                and practical enough while styling it up a bit. All the working surfaces should be strong and durable.
                Install the right cabinetry/hardware, appliances, installation and countertops as they collectively
                constitute more than 50% of the entire kitchen cost. Kitchens are now also constructed on an open-plan
                format so you can make use of adorable kitchen islands for a great cooking and eating experience, and
                match with the decor of the merged room.

                Some great renovation ideas for the bedroom and kid’s room can include decorative headboards, generous
                square footage, reflective and smart-looking wardrobes, soft and pastel wall shades, thoughtful lighting
                and awe-inspiring wall-to-ceiling designs. You can go more creative and playful while renovating your
                kid’s bedroom.

            <h1> Bathroom Renovation </h1>
            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag">
                Bathroom renovation is the biggest do-it-yourself renovation project that can bear significant expenses
                if it is done entirely or if another one is added to the house plan. It also takes the longest if the
                workforce does not coordinate properly. Consider getting large tiles so that you can see fewer grout
                lines and it is easier to clean. Install the correct choice of hung toilets, shower area, fixtures,
                countertops and cabinets since they also make up more than 50% of the entire bathroom cost.
